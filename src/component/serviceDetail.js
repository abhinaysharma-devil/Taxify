                        <p>
                            A GSTIN or GST number is public information. GST search by name is an important task that every business dealing with GST-registered taxpayers must carry out to ensure the authenticity of the vendor and the GSTIN or GST number being used in the invoice. <br /><br />

                            You can partly verify the GSTIN or GST number on the first look by checking if the vendorâ€™s PAN number matches with the digits between 3 and 10 in the GSTIN. <br /><br />

                            It is also necessary to carry out a thorough check of the GSTIN authenticity to avoid generating incorrect invoices and e-invoices, to claim a genuine input tax credit, and to pass on the tax credits to rightful buyers, to mention a few.
